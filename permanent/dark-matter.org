An elusive substance that permeates the universe exerts many detectable
gravitational influences yet eludes direct detection.

Physicists and astronomers have determined that most of the material in
the universe is "dark matter" whose existence we infer from its
gravitational effects but not through electromagnetic influences such as
we find with ordinary, familiar matter.

One of the simplest concepts in physics, dark matter can nonetheless be
mystifying because of our human perspective. Each of us has five senses,
all of which originate in electromagnetic interactions. Vision, for
example, is based on our sensitivity to light: electromagnetic waves
that lie within a specific range of frequencies.

We can see the matter with which we are familiar because the atoms that
make it up emit or absorb light. The electric charges carried by the
electrons and protons in atoms are the reason we can see.
