*** TODO add feature to fix links when change detected in buffer :@computer:
If there's a hook I can tie into when a headline is changed, then maybe...
Otherwise, I would have to use some sort of caching to store headlines by file
and their index location.

:END:
At the time I was trying to capture this link: https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2015/09/hypothesis-testing-explained/
Fixed the problem, so my function was not going back to the beginning of the
buffer before searching for the headline.

:END:
Because right now it's scattered around after I tried switching over to
youtrack, so I need to reel everything back into place.
* Projects
** Managing my DOOM Emacs Configuration
*** New items to check out
*** Agenda Configuration
The agenda's goal is to keep me focused on what I need to work on NEXT, and not
have any type of distractions or things that would distract my focus onto other
things.

**** Staying focused on the task
What are some important key concepts to keep in consideration for the agenda? \\
+ Do not clutter the agenda, keep it clean.
+ Only put what you absolutely need on the calendar
+ Anything with an active timestamp should be intended because we need perform some sort of action on that day
  - Absolutely for no reason, should anything else use an active timestamp and appear on the calendar.
  - For logging, we can use org-agenda-log-mode to track activity.

#+caption: Master Agenda
| Category            | Description                                            | Distraction? |
|---------------------+--------------------------------------------------------+--------------|
| Agenda              | Scheduled Tasks                                        | No           |
| Stuck Projects      | Projects which do not have a NEXT task defined.        | Yes          |
| Projects            | Projects with a NEXT task defined.                     | Yes          |
| Project Next Tasks  | Projects Next Tasks ready to work.                     | No           |
| Project Subtasks    | Projects TODO tasks that need work defined.            | Yes          |
| Standalone Tasks    | NEXT tasks that are not part of a project.             | No           |
| Waiting & Postponed | Tasks that are in a WAIT state.                        | Yes          |
| Inbox Bucket        | Tasks which are in TODO state with no actions defined. | Yes          |
|---------------------+--------------------------------------------------------+--------------|

**** Setting up org-ql in my workflow
<2020-10-31 Sat 21:52> So org-ql looks promising, i'm going to give it a try and
see how it works in my configuration...

Here's what I must have:
+ +Projects subtasks+
+ Something else
+ +Sub-Projects+
+ Stuck Projects
+ +Agenda Like+
+ +Inbox Bucket (- SOMEDAY)+
+ SOMEDAY Bucket
+ Standalone NEXT tasks
+ Recent Activity (with input for number of days)

*** Task Management

**** DONE Using Tasks vs Checkboxes
CLOSED: [2020-12-08 Tue 22:54]

#+caption: How checkboxes should be used
- Don't need to keep a record or task history (ok with it being deleted)
- Quick tasks that require little upkeep
- Should have a way to kill your checkboxes and convert to task tho

#+caption: How task items should be used
- For anything that we need to track
- Need a record of the item
- Research items that we'll be tracking notes in

#+caption: When to use individual task files
- Anything that's going to impact the over-all use of that item (for records purposes)
- Large scale projects that impact the subject

| Individual Task Files                | Task Items | Checkboxes |
|--------------------------------------+------------+------------|
| Anything that's centralized on topic |            |            |

**** DONE [#A] Improving Task States
CLOSED: [2020-12-08 Tue 22:54]
:LOGBOOK:
- Note taken on [2020-11-06 Fri 22:23] \\
  I need to look into using ~org-map-entries~ to have my function run through an org buffer and correct my task-states.
- Note taken on [2020-11-06 Fri 21:24] \\
  I was facing losing the ability to keep tracking of my task states, and keeping my things in order to complete certain items. So I have adopted a new system that takes my task items, and moves them into a more automated system.
:END:
-----
So overall the automation works well, but if I want to other TASK keywords it
becomes a problem, and could probably become a headache to try and keep track of
tasks. Ultimately, we need to keep this system stupid simple.

***** DONE Automating setting my "TODO/NEXT/WAIT/PROJ/DONE" states :@code:
CLOSED: [2020-11-06 Fri 20:41]
+ Updates task states when it detects a conditional statement is true.
+ Swaps any TASK item to a PROJ when subtasks exist.

***** DONE Test using ~org-map-entries~ :@test:
CLOSED: [2020-11-11 Wed 23:52]
It works, so i've implemented it into my config file.

#+caption: recap of "testing org-map-entries" on <2020-11-14 10:09>
Using this method has it's benefits, but there's a slight issue that it doesn't
really indicate what headline we're focused on.

**** DONE Capture notes on the fly
CLOSED: [2020-11-16 Mon 22:23]

#+caption: recap of "testing my new function" on <2020-11-15 Sun 00:33>
So after working on this, i've got a new system to focus on capturing notes to
my task on the fly w/out having to loose focus on my current task. It works by
using the org-capture template system, and org-refile-get-location to prompt the
user to enter a headline.
