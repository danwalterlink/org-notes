So essentially it's like saying, you want to measure the success of your sales
team by measuring their revenues over the quarter. When you introduce this as a
measure, that point of reference is not influencing the sales reps to hit the
mark, because its just that a measure. However if you were to introduce that
measure as a target, saying your sales reps have to hit target... Well then you
have inflation, because then you have those who are just going to aim for that
target value and that's it.

When a measure becomse a target, it ceases to be a good measure.
