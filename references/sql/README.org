- Database − A database is a collection of tables, with related data.
- Table − A table is a matrix with data. A table in a database looks
  like a simple spreadsheet.
- Column − One column (data element) contains data of one and the same
  kind, for example the column postcode.
- Row − A row (= tuple, entry or record) is a group of related data, for
  example the data of one subscription.
- Redundancy − Storing data twice, redundantly to make the system
  faster.
- Primary Key − A primary key is unique. A key value can not occur twice
  in one table. With a key, you can only find one row.
- Foreign Key − A foreign key is the linking pin between two tables.
- Compound Key − A compound key (composite key) is a key that consists
  of multiple columns, because one column is not sufficiently unique.
- Index − An index in a database resembles an index at the back of a
  book.
- Referential Integrity − Referential Integrity makes sure that a
  foreign key value always points to an existing row.
