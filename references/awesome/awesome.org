** spotdl

Allows one to download entire playlists from Spotify, by specifying the
playlist link. To install the app simply run =pip install spotdl=. Then,
you typically run two commands to download a playlist. The first is to
fetch the list and store the results into a .txt file, then the 2nd step
will feed the contents of that list to spotdl. -
