By all outward appearances our life is a spark of light between one
eternal darkness and another.

If living is to end in pain, incompleteness, and nothingness, it seems a
cruel and futile experience for beings who are born to reason, hope,
create, and love.

Man, as a being of sense, wants his life to make sense, and he has found
it hard to believe that it does so unless there is more than what he
sees---unless there is an eternal order and an eternal life-and-death.

If happiness always depends on something expected in the future, we are
chasing a will-o'-the-wisp that ever eludes our grasp, until the future,
and ourselves, vanish into the abyss of death.

However long postponed, everything composed must decompose. Death is
Inevitable.
