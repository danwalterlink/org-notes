* How art affects our experiences

Something new that I thought of, is how art can impact or affect our
experiences in life? And how it is, that art affects or can
fundamentally alter past experiences as well.

One interesting thing that I recently came across as well, is how art is
sometimes seen as a way we can leave behind a piece of ourselves after
we are long gone.
