Brain activity that corresponds with and is necessary to produce a
particular experience. For example, the neural correlates of
consciousness are the events that must occur in the brain for
consciousness to become manifest.

The neural correlates of consciousness (NCC) constitute the minimal set
of neuronal events and mechanisms sufficient for a specific conscious
percept. Neuro Scientists use empirical approaches to discover neural
correlates of subjective phenomena; that is, neural changes which
necessarily and regularly correlate with a specific experience.

The set should be minimal because, under the assumption that the brain
is sufficient to give rise to any given conscious experience, the
question is which of its components is necessary to produce it.
