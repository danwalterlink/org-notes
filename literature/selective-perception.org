It makes you see, listen, or focus your attention on a
[[[file:stimulus]]] based on your expectations, without taking into
account the rest of the information. It all relates to your preconceived
ideas, interests, desires, and fears regarding different events and
situations.

Selective perception is a mechanism that allows you to filter the
relevant information and avoid a [[[file:stimulus]]] overload. However,
in many situations, it will cause you to lose or miss out on very
valuable information.
