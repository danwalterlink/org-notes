The article discusses about Luhmann's slip-box, or Zettelkasten. The idea is
that your notes become your "second brain", secodary memory or else. He would
later come about as one of the most influential sociologist and scientist of the
20th century.

Here's a breakdown of how it works:
- Luhmann wrote down interesting or potentially useful ideas he
  encountered in his reading on uniformly sized index cards
- He wrote only on one side of each card to eliminate the need to flip
  them over, and he limited himself to one idea per card so they could
  be referenced individually
- Each new index card received a sequential number, starting at 1. When
  a new source was added to that topic, or he found something to
  supplement it, he would add new index cards with letters as suffixes
  (1a, 1b, 1c, etc.)
- These branching connections were marked in red as close as possible to
  the point where the branch began
- Any of these branches could also have their own branches. The card for
  fellow German sociologist JÃ¼rgen Habermas, for example, was labeled
  21/3d26g53
- As he read, he would create new cards, update or add comments to
  existing ones, create new branches from existing cards, and create new
  links between cards on different "strands"

One thing that it points out is about creating an index for a new idea, starting
at 1 and then as you add new index cards tied to that idea, you would indicate
it's branch by adding a suffix letter to the index.  ("index 1" -> "index 1a")

* Principle 1: Writing is not the outcome of thinking; it is the medium in which thinking takes place

Essentially writing doesn't take place until we have an experience, and
experience from the things we read, listen or involved in. Such as podcasts, a
life experience, a piece of art and how it affects the person. (See How art
affects our experience)

If you want to learn, or keep track of something you read, even if you don't
write a grand theory on the thing, you still need a way to keep track of the
things you read or learn.

  It's Iike learning to swim -- you have to learn by doing it, not by
  merely reading about it.
#+END_QUOTE

Reading, is not so much just to learn something new, but to understand it and
the more connections we can tie to a concept, or idea then the more it makes
sense or we can make sense of it.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
For example, you could memorize the fact that arteries are red and
veins are blue. But it is only when you understand why -- that
arteries carry oxygen-rich blood from the heart to the rest of the
body, while veins carry blood low in oxygen back to the heart -- that
that fact has any value. And once we make this meaningful connection
between ideas, it's hard not to remember it.
#+END_QUOTE

Essentially, the meaning of something requires elaboration, and such elaboration
that it's often times difficult to complete this in our head, so instead we need
to lay it out into writings, things we put into our own words in order to
comprehend its meaning.

* Principle 2: Do your work as if writing is the only thing that matters

The idea is that any research that is not published, or publicly available is
essentially the same as not having the idea at all. For what is an idea, if it's
not to be shared, and challenged by others?

This does not mean you have to go publish every idea, neither great nor small or
write a blog post about it, but what it does mean is that in some capacity we
share these ideas with our friends, family, coworkers so that our ideas get out
there and amongst others to stem off.

For us to take effective notes, is not to essentially copy every detail of what
we consume in order to memorize it, but to break it down into its simplest forms
so that questions can arise from it. This is where our critical thinking then
kicks in, and allows us to build connections, curiosuity will then lead to more
questions pertaining back to the root of the very topic itself.

* Principle 3: Nobody starts from scratch

Creativity is not the creation of something from nothing, but it's the taking of
something that's already there, and exploring it in a new way.

So essentially, creativity first starts with understanding, and then allowing
our creativity to expand upon that original idea into new ideas, new theories,
and even more problems to be solved.

And because of this, in order to create something new, or have creativitiy we
often times have to make notes of these things we research or study, otherwise
we are stuck retracing our steps or trying to be creative without the prior
research, which can ultimately lead to us failing.

* Principle 4: Our tools and techniques are only as valuable as the workflow

Essentially, we need a workflow to capture, collect, analyze and share our
ideas. Because without an established workflow, we can end up backtracing our
steps or trying to create something without doing our much needed research.

* Principle 5: Standardization enables creativity

How does this impact our modern age of technology where saving information is
"much easier"? How can all these tools still not solve the problem of
categorizing this data? It's the lack of a workflow, it's what some may refer to
as the "scattered" brain, because you're thoughts are often scattered across
multiple mediums trying to "retrace" what you have captured.

Instead of trying to create a new system each time you take notes, standardize
one system so that everything flows in the same method.

Only then can we focus on the: thinking, reflecting, writing, discussing,
testing, and sharing.

* Principle 6: Exposing our work to high quality feedback

The idea is to take critical feedback on our ideas, theories so that they can
help us shape them with stronger points, and ensure we have looked at all
avenues and we are not forgetting any key concepts.

* Principle 7: Work on multiple, simultaneous projects

When you read a new article, blog, book or whatever it may be... That medium
which you consume will cover multiple things, and spread multiple topics, some
relevant and others not so relevant to your current research.

This is why if you have multiple projects, or research topics, it'll broaden how
much you are able to absorb in that one particular medium.

In addition, it can also stem off or branch new subjects that you may find
curious enough to look into at a later date.

* Principle 8: Organizine your notes by context, not by topic.

It's often we will want to try and add more specific topics, and subtopics to
something we consume, so much that over-time you'll have such specific topics
that it'll be difficult to see how they relate to other things.

So essentially you want to file them away by their "context" of what they are
going towards.

* Principle 9: Follow the most intresting path

Basically it's to take the path we find the most interesting, that'll keep us
engaged the most over any other thing.

* Principle 10: Save contradictory ideas

It's important to save ideas that are contradictory or paradoxical, they are
essential to helping us raise new questions and validate our research. It'll
also help us to ensure that the information we do have is valid.

The problem does not lie with external authority, but with our own intertia. We
have to counteract "confirmation bias" - our tendency to take into account only
information that confirms what we already belielve. We need to regularly
confront our errors, mistakes and misunderstandings. (See Being understandable)

So by taking notes on a wide variety of sources, and in objective formats that
exist outside of our heads, we practice the skill of seeing what is really there
and describing it plainfully and factually.
