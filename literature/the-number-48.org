There is something about the water's energy level being 4.18 being key
to what allows the earth to thrive in life.

Specific heat of water is 1 & not 4.18. By definition specific heat is
the amount of heat in calories required to raise temperature of one gram
of water through one degree centigrade. So 1 gram of water requires 1
calorie of heat to raise its temperature through 1 degree centigrade &
the formula is :mxsxt = calories of heat where m is the mass of water, s
is the specific heat & t is rise in temperature.
