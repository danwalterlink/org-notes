Getting things done is a [[methodology]] that turns around the focus of
task management, and provides a simple approach to managing everything
you need to do.

* Capturing things you need to do

The whole idea behind GTD, is to not linger or hold onto the thoughts of
things you need to get done.

Instead, you should document them in a process where you can process
those things when you are ready, and determine what next steps need to
be taken with that thought.
