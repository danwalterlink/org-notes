task management, and provides a simple approach to managing everything
you need to do.

** Capturing things you need to do
   :PROPERTIES:

   :END:

The whole idea behind GTD, is to not linger or hold onto the thoughts of
things you need to get done.

Instead, you should document them in a process where you can process
those things when you are ready, and determine what next steps need to
be taken with that thought.
