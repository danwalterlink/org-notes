* How to reduce Bias in Decision Making

When a problem, or issue arises, we need to make a decision about what
to do. When that process kicks-in, we engage in a process to come up
with that solution. So what does that process look like?

Well, during the process, our mind will make several shortcuts to come
up with a final decision making, known as [[[[file:../psychology/202101091301-biases.org][biases]]]]
- Tendency to be influenced by the way a problem is formulated even though it
  should not affect the solution.
- Rely upon knowledge that is readily available rather than examine other
  alternatives or procedures.
- Selecting information or making decisions that further our own self-interests
  instead of the organization or team.
- Use a clear decision making process like USC-CT to reduce these errors.

** The USC-CT Model:

- Uncover the various potential problems, challenges & opportunities vis-Ã -vis
  organizational goals.
- Select the most critical problem(s), challenge(s) and/or opportunity(ies).
  Prioritize.
- Create a multitude of potential solutions.
- Choose the solution(s) that has the potential to be the most effective.
- Translate your solution(s) into an effective implementation plan.
