* Chapter 2. Supervised Learning

** Classification and Regression

There are two major types of [[[file:../fleeting/202101232318-supervised_learning.org][supervised learning]]], called classification and
regression. 

+ Classification
  - Binary classification
  - Predict a class label, from a list of possibilities.
  - Can have multiclass, such as determining an Iris species.
+ Regression
  - predict a continous number, or a floating point number in programming terms.
  - predicting persons income based on education, age, location is regression.

** Generalization, Overfitting, and Underfitting

Generalization is saying our model is able to make accurate predictions on our
test data, using our training set. The goal is to generalize as accurately as
possible.

Contrary, building a model too complex for the amount of information we have, is
called Overfitting. This occurs when you fit a model too closely to the
particularities of the training set and obtain a model that works well on the
training set but is not able to generalize to new data.

There's a sweet spot in-betwen the two that will yield the best generalization
performance.
