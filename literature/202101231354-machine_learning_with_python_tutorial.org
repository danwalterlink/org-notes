* Machine Learning with Python

** Basics

Machine Learning basically allows the computer to make sense of the data. It
extracts patterns out of data using a set of algorithm and or method.

The idea behind Machine Learning, is to help humans make decisions, based on
data.

Before discussing the machine learning model, we must need to understand the
following formal definition of ML given by professor Mitchell:

#+begin_quote
“A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some
class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as
measured by P, improves with experience E.”
#+end_quote

The above quote basically calls-out the three elements to the machine learning
objective, knowing this we can define Machine Learning as:
+ Improve their performance (P)
+ At executing some task (T)
+ Over time with Experience (E)

**** Task (T)

We can define (T "[[[[file:~/projects/orgmode/fleeting/202101231438-task.org][Task]]]]") as the real-world problem to be solved. The problem
which we are trying to solve can be finding housing prices, to marketing
strategy, etc. On the other hand, if we talk about Machine Learning, the
definition for (T) would be different, because our Task that we are trying to
solve is different than the normal.

So basically a (T) Task is said to be based on Machine Learning, when the (T) is
based on the process, and the system must follow for operating on data points.
The examples for Machine Learning are Classification, Regression, Structured
annotation, Clustering, Transcription, etc.

**** Experience (E)

So (E) is essentially our data that's used to build knowledge, which in turn is
applied towards solving our (T) by analyzing and finding patterns.

**** Performance (P)

Our (P) is a measure of how well our Machine Learning algorithm is performing
based on our expectations given its output. (P) is basically a quantitative
metric that tells how a model is performing Task (T), using its Experience (E).
There are many metrics that help understand the Machine Learning performance
(P), such as; accuracy score, F1 score, confusion matrix, precision, recall,
sensitivity, etc...

*** Challenges in Machine Learning

Essentially Machine Learning is still in it's early primes, and has many
improvements to be made, such as in the following areas:
+ quality of data :: Having good-quality data for ML algorithms is one of the
  biggest challenges. Use of low-quality data leads to the problems related to
  data preprocessing and feature extraction.
+ Time-Consuming task :: Another challenge faced by ML models is the consumption
  of time especially for data acquisition, feature extraction and retrieval.
+ Lack of specialist persons :: As ML technology is still in its infancy stage,
  availability of expert resources is a tough job.
+ No clear objective for formulating business problems :: Having no clear
  objective and well-defined goal for business problems is another key
  challenge for ML because this technology is not that mature yet.
+ Issue of overfitting & underfitting :: If the model is overfitting or
  underfitting, it cannot be represented well for the problem.
+ Curse of dimensionality :: Another challenge ML model faces is too many
  features of data points. This can be a real hindrance.
+ Difficulty in deployment :: Complexity of the ML model makes it quite
  difficult to be deployed in real life.

*** Applications of Machine Learning

We are in the midst golden-age of AI and Machine Learning. Some example
applications for machine learning are:
+ Emotion analysis
+ Sentiment analysis
+ Error detection and prevention
+ Weather forecasting and prediction
+ Stock market analysis and forecasting
+ Speech synthesis
+ Speech recognition
+ Customer segmentation
+ Object recognition
+ Fraud detection
+ Fraud prevention
+ Recommendation of products to customer in online shopping

Basically there are multiple Machine Learning algorithms, techniques and methods
that can be applied to build models for solving real-life problems by using data.

*** Different types of Methods

The following are various ML Methods based on some broad categories:

**** Supervised Learning

*Supervised Learning*: this is basically taking the input data, and associating it
with the expected outcome results. Some examples of this:
- x: input variables
- y: output variable
- ~Y=f(x)~

The idea would be to approximate the output given the input data we are given.
Supervised algorithms can be categorized as:
+ Classification
+ Regression

***** Classification

Predict the categorical output labels or response for the given input data. The
output will be based on what the model has learned in the training phase.

***** Regression

Predict output labels or responses that are continues numeric values, for the
given input data. The output will be based on what the model has learned in its
training phase.

**** Unsupervised Learning

Opposite of supervised Machine Learning algorithms, which basically means we
have no supervisor to provide any sort of guidance. This is for instance, which
we do not have the liberty of having pre-labeled training data and we want to
extract useful patterns from input data.

For instance, say you have input variables, but there would be no output
variable and the algorithms need to discover the interesting pattern in data for
learning.

Examples of unsupervised learning are: k-means clustering, k-nearest neighbors,
etc...

Unsupervised learning is categorized in the following:

***** Clustering

One of the most powerful unsupervised Machine Learning methods. Used to find
similarity as well as relationship patterns among data samples and then cluster
those samples into groups based on features. An example of this would be
grouping customers by their purchasing behavior.

***** Association

Essentially is another useful algorithm for finding patterns which further
represents the interesting relationships between various items. An example of
this, is to analyze a customers shopping patterns.

***** Dimensionality Reduction

Reduce number of feature variables for each data sample by selecting set of
principal or representative features. Question arises of why we need to reduce
the [[[[file:~/projects/orgmode/fleeting/202101232008-dimensionality.org][dimensionality]]]]? The reason behins is the problem of [[[[file:~/projects/orgmode/fleeting/202101232009-feature_space_complexity.org][feature space
complexity]]]] which arises when we start analyzing and extracting millions of
features from data samples. This problem generally refers to "curse of
[[[[file:~/projects/orgmode/fleeting/202101232008-dimensionality.org][dimensionality]]]]". Principal Component Analysis, K-nearest neighbors and
discriminant analysis are some of the popular algorithms for this purpose.

***** Anomaly Detection

Used to find the occurrences of rare events or observations that generally do
not occur. Some of the unsupervised algorithms like clustering, KNN can detect
anomalies based on the data and its features.
