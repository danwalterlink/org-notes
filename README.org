Hey there, and welcome to my little corner of space, where I share a little bit
of what I have learned over the course of my time in this world as I share and
try connecting the dots using the Zettelkasten note-taking method.

The ultimate goal :dart: of this repository is to remain my primary source of
storing all of my knowledge. Hopefully over time this will grow to something
that really shows the power of how Zettelkasten works.

* Interested in my configuration?

I'm using EMACS, with org-mode, DOOM-Emacs distro and org-roam to make all of
this work. If you are interested in my configuration, you can head over here to
check it out -> [[https://github.com/nmartin84/.doom.d][nmartin84/.doom.d]]
