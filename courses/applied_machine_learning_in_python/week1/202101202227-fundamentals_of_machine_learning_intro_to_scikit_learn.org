* Introduction

Machine learning models can learn by example. Algorithms learn rules from
example data. A set of labeled examples used for learning called [[[[file:~/projects/orgmode/programming/202101212124-training_data.org][training
data]]]].

The learned rules should also be able to generalize to correctly recognize or
predict new examples not in the original [[[[file:~/projects/orgmode/programming/202101212124-training_data.org][training data]]]].

So to conclude on this, it's good to understand that machine learning draws heavily
on [[[[file:~/projects/orgmode/statistics/202101212128-statistics.org][statistics]]]] (estimate reliability of predictions, infer conclusions of
data), in addition to [[[[file:~/projects/orgmode/programming/202101212129-computer_science.org][computer science]]]] for (large-scale computing,
algorithms to capture, manipulate, index, combine, retrieve and perform
predictions on data).
