While loops is a [[[file:../202101021249-python_control_structures.org][python control structures]]] which will run through a body of
code long as the condition remains *true*.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
  x = 5
  while x < 5:
      print(f'The value of x is {x}')
      x = x + 1
  else:
      print('X is not less than 5')
#+END_SRC

* while loop list and output results

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  wlist = [2,4,5,6,7,8]
  index = 0

  # One way is using pop if you want pull everything out of the list
  while len(wlist) > 0:
      print(list.pop(wlist))

  # Another way is incrementing the index ingeger until it's higher than the length of the variable name.
  index = 0
  while index < len(wlist):
      index = index + 1
      print(wlist)
#+END_EXAMPLE

* While Break Statement

With the break statement we can stop the loop even if the while
condition is true:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  i = 1
  while i < 6:
    print(i)
    if i == 3:
      break
    i += 1
#+END_EXAMPLE

* While Continue Statement

With the continue statement we can stop the current iteration, and
continue with the next:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  i = 0
  while i < 6:
    i += 1
    if i == 3:
      continue
    print(i)
#+END_EXAMPLE

* While Else Statement

With the else statement we can run a block of code once when the
condition no longer is true:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  i = 1
  while i < 6:
    print(i)
    i += 1
  else:
    print("i is no longer less than 6")
#+END_EXAMPLE
