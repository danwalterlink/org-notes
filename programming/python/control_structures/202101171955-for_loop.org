The *for* statement is a great statement ([[[[file:../202101021249-python_control_structures.org][python control structures]]]]) to run
through a list of items and perform an action on each of those items in the
list.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  list = [1,2,3,4,5]
  for num in list:
      print(num)
#+END_EXAMPLE

* Ranges in For Loop

To create a range of numbers. The number =0= is the start of the range,
the =10= is the end of the range and the =2= is telling it to increment
by this number.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  for num in range(0,10,2):
      print(num)
#+END_EXAMPLE

* For loop with IF and ELSE statements

The below example will print out all your event numbers, and odd numbers
will return the string =Odd number is $var=.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  list = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
  for num in list:
      if num % 2 == 0:
          print(num)
      else:
          print(f'Odd number is {num}')
#+END_EXAMPLE

* FOR loop to calculate total

Another method of using this is to calculate and give you the total, or
output the output after each loop.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  list = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
  list_sum = 0
  for num in list:
      list_sum = list_sum + num
      print(list_sum)
  return print(list_sum)
#+END_EXAMPLE

* FOR loop with tuples printing both indexes

And for indexing, you can pass two arguments to essentially act as the
index number:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  list = [(1,2)(3,4)(5,6)(7,8)]
  for a,b in list:
      print(a)
      print(b)

  for a,b in list:
      if a % 2 == 0:
          print('Even number detected {a}')
      elif b % 2 == 0:
          print('The number is even {b}')
      else:
          print('No numbers returned')

  return(type(list))
#+END_EXAMPLE

* FOR loop with Dictionaries

For dictionaries it's a little different

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  d = {'key1':'string1','key2':'string2'}
  for key,value in d.items():
      print(value)
#+END_EXAMPLE

* Break FOR loop when IF condition is true

#+BEGIN_SRC python
  fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
      for x in fruits:
            print(x)
      if x == "banana":
          break
#+END_SRC
