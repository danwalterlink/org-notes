A scope is essentially where your variable is defined at. For instance, you can
define a variable at the function level, which makes that variable avialable to
the function and anything that calls that function. It's also possible to make a
variable global by calling the ~global~ keyword.

#+begin_src python :results code output :exports both
x = 300

def myfunc():
  global x
  x = 200

myfunc()

print(x)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src python
200
#+end_src
