Membership [[[[file:../202101021700-python_operators.org][python operators]]]] are used to test if a sequence is presented in
an object:

- ~in~ - returns true if a sequence with the specified value is present in the object.
- ~not in~ - returns true if a sequence with the specified value is not present in
  the object.
