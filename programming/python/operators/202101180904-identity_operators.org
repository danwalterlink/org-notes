Identity [[[[file:../202101021700-python_operators.org][python operators]]]] are used to compare the objects, not if they are
equal, but if they are actually the same object, with the same memory location:

- ~is~ - returns true if both variables are the same.
- ~is not~ - returns true if both variables are not the same.
