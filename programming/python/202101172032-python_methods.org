A method in [[[[file:202101171320-python.org][python]]]] is somewhat similar to a [[[[file:202101172028-python_functions.org][python functions]]]], except it is associated
with object/classes. Methods in python are very similar to functions except for
two major differences.
+ The method is implicitly used for an object for which it is called.
+ The method is accessible to data that is contained within the class.
