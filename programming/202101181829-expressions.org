In computer science, an expression is a syntactic entity in a [[[[file:202101161003-programming_language.org][programming
language]]]] that may be evaluated to determine its value. It is a combination of
one or more constants, variables, functions, and operators that the
[[[[file:202101161003-programming_language.org][programming language]]]] interprets (according to its particular rules of
precedence and of association) and computes to produce ("to return", in a
stateful environment) another value. This process, for [[[[file:202101181831-mathematical_expression.org][mathematical expression]]]],
is called evaluation.

In simple settings, the [[[[file:202101181840-return_type.org][resulting value]]]] is usually one of various
[[[[file:202101181844-primitive_types.org][primitive types]]]], such as numerical, [[[[file:202101181845-string.org][string]]]], [[[[file:202101181845-boolean.org][boolean]]]], [[[[file:202101181845-complex_data_type.org][complex data
type]]]] or other types.

Expression is often contrasted with [[[[file:202101181828-statement.org][statement]]]] - a syntactic entity, which
has no value (an instruction.)
