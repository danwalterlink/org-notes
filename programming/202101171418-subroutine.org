In [[[[file:202101161933-computer_programming.org][computer programming]]]], a subroutine is a sequence of program
instructions that performs a specific task, packaged as a unit. This unit can
then be used in programs wherever that particular task should be performed.

Subroutines may be defined within programs, or separately in libraries that can
be used by many programs. In different [[[[file:202101161003-programming_language.org][programming language]]]], a subroutine
may be called a routine, subprogram, function, method, or procedure.
Technically, these terms all have different definitions. The generic, umbrella
term callable unit is sometimes used.
