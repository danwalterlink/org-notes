Modular Programming is essentially breaking up your code, into specific
sections, or smaller packages that aim to tackle a specific problem or function.
The idea behind modular programming is to provide these modules with minimal
dependencies to simplify its needs (See [[[[file:202101161933-computer_programming.org][computer programming]]]]).
