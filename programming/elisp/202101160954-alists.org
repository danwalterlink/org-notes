So an A-List in elisp coding is basically like a list of [[[[file:202101160955-cons.org][cons]]]] to make up the
list. An A-List is a [[[[file:202101172013-elisp_datatypes.org][elisp datatypes]]]] unique to elisp. As you may remember,
to build a cons you would use:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(cons 1 2)
#+end_src

And to make an a-list you would do something like this:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq some-alist '((one . 1)
                   (two . 2)
                   (three . 3)))

(alist-get 'one some-alist) ; returns 1
(assq 'one some-alist) ; returns one
(rassq 1 some-alist) ; returns index of the value 1 (one)

;; To set a new place in a given cons
(setf (alist-get 'one some-alist) 5) ; assigns the value "5" to the index "one"
(alist-get 'one some-alist) ; returns 5
#+end_src
