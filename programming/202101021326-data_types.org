In computer science and [[[[file:202101161933-computer_programming.org][computer programming]]]], a data type or simply type is
an attribute of data which tells the compiler or interpreter how the programmer
intends to use the data. Most programming languages support basic data types of
integer numbers (of varying sizes), floating-point numbers (which approximate
real numbers), characters and Booleans. A data type constrains the values that
an expression, such as a variable or a function, might take. This data type
defines the operations that can be done on the data, the meaning of the data,
and the way values of that type can be stored. A data type provides a set of
values from which an expression (i.e. variable, function, etc.) may take its
values.

The data types to know are:
1. String
2. Character
3. Integer
4. Float
5. Boolean
