In [[[[file:202101171440-object_oriented_programming.org][object-oriented programming]]]], a field (also called data member or [[[[file:202101171507-member_variable.org][member
variable]]]]) is a particular piece of data encapsulated within a [[[[file:202101171505-class.org][class]]]] or
[[[[file:202101171444-object.org][object]]]]. In the case of a regular field (also called instance variable), for
each instance of the object there is an instance variable: for example, an
Employee class has a Name field and there is one distinct name per employee. A
static field (also called class variable) is one variable, which is shared by
all instances. Fields are abstracted by properties, which allow them to be read
and written as if they were fields, but these can be translated to getter and
setter method calls.
