In [[[[file:202101161933-computer_programming.org][computer programming]]]], a statement is a syntactic unit of an imperative
[[[[file:202101161003-programming_language.org][programming language]]]] that expresses some action to be carried out. A program
written in such a language is formed by a sequence of one or more statements. A
statement may have internal components (e.g., [[[[file:202101181829-expressions.org][expressions]]]]).

Many imperative languages (e.g. C) make a distinction between statements and
definitions, with a statement only containing executable code and a definition
instantiating an identifier, while an expression evaluates to a value only. A
distinction can also be made between simple and compound statements; the latter
may contain statements as components.
