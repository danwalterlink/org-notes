With statements is a [[[[file:202101021249-python_control_structures.org][python control structures]]]], which has a ~__ENTER__~ and
~__EXIT__~ function that it calls at the start and end of its statement.

It's commonly used for unmanaged resources, such as opening a file to ensure the
file is then closed when you're done with the resource.

#+begin_src python
try:
    file = open("myFile.txt", "r")
    print(file.read())
except:
    print("An error has occurred!")
finally:
    file.close()
#+end_src

Or another example:
#+begin_src python
with open("myFile.txt", "r") as file:
    print(file.read())
#+end_src
