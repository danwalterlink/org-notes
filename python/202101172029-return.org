A return statement is used to end the execution of the [[[[file:202101172028-python_functions.org][python functions]]]] and
[[[[file:202101172032-python_methods.org][python methods]]]] call and "returns" the result (value of the expression
following the return keyword) to the caller. The statements after the return
statements are not executed. If the return statement is without any expression,
then the special value None is returned.
