Bitwise [[[[file:202101021700-python_operators.org][python operators]]]] are used to compare (binary) numbers:

+ ~&~ :: Sets each bits to 1 if both are 1.
+ ~|~ :: Sets each bit to 1 if one of two bits is 1
+ ~^~ :: Sets each bit to 1 if only one of two bits is 1
+ ~~~ :: Inverts all the bits
+ ~<<~ :: Shift left by pushing zeros in from the right and let the leftmost bits fall off
+ ~>>~ :: Shift right by pushing copies of the leftmost bit in from the left, and let the rightmost bits fall off
